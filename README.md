# Silent Friend Beeper

For when your friends go **silent mid-game** and you want to bother them.

It beeps after **7.5 seconds** to wake them up.  
Very crucial when they are in a 1v5 and wanna clutch and demand silence (you will never get it <3).

Because silence mid-clutch? Nah, thatâ€™s not happening.

Use this to annoy your friends enough to break their radio silence â€” especially when theyâ€™re pretending to be monks while youâ€™re trying to win.

## How it works

- Friend goes silent.
- After 7.5 seconds of no response, the beep sounds.
- Silence is broken. Communication (or complaining) resumes.
- Game continues.

---

## Usage notes

- Use sparingly â€” too many beeps might lead to some salty reactions.
- Perfect for keeping your team awake during clutch moments.
